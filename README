HANDIN:
Final handin


DESIGN CHOICES:
The top-most class is the App class, which contains an instance of the pane organizer class
which contains an instance of the game class, which contains an instance of the doodle class
and multiple instances of the platform class.

The doodle and all of the platforms are graphically added to the doodlePane which is added to the
root pane. A timehandler is used to control movement of the doodle and platforms, so every .016
seconds, it updates and checks to see if the doodle is falling, if it's intersected a platform,
and where its current position is. Based on these factors, the doodle and platforms adjust
accordingly.
