/**
 * This is your Constants class. It defines some constants you will need
 * in DoodleJump, using the default values from the demo--you shouldn't
 * need to change any of these values unless you want to experiment. Feel
 * free to add more constants to this class!
 *
 * A NOTE ON THE GRAVITY CONSTANT:
 *   Because our y-position is in pixels rather than meters, we'll need our
 *   gravity to be in units of pixels/sec^2 rather than the usual 9.8m/sec^2.
 *   There's not an exact conversion from pixels to meters since different
 *   monitors have varying numbers of pixels per inch, but assuming a fairly
 *   standard 72 pixels per inch, that means that one meter is roughly 2800
 *   pixels. However, a gravity of 2800 pixels/sec2 might feel a bit fast. We
 *   suggest you use a gravity of about 1000 pixels/sec2. Feel free to change
 *   this value, but make sure your game is playable with the value you choose.
